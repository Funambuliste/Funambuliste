- 👋 Hi, I’m @Funambuliste
- 👀 I’m interested in creating things by myself : knitting, sewing, cooking, gardening, DIY, ... and <strong>programming</strong>. 
- I learnt a bit of basic a long time ago <- forgot everything, 
- a tad more of html not so long ago <-have some rest 
- and around the same of python recently <- still difficult.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming. 
- Right now, I am going throught Odin project since it seems to be recommended for beginner no matter the direction you are going to take.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on stuff that I can do. Which unfortunately must not amount to much as of now. But well who do not try do not learn.
- 📫 How to reach me I do not know GitHub well yet. Do they have some messaging system ? If yes, that is the way.
